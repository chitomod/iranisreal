# israel_iran_conflict_research

I have completed a comprehensive research report on the current status of the Israel-Iran conflict as of June 2025. The report covers the current situation, a timeline of recent events, key geographic locations, metrics for dashboard visualization, and the regional and international context. A separate file with a list of reliable news sources and APIs has also been created to support the development of a real-time dashboard.
