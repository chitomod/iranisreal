# Research Plan: Israel-Iran Conflict

## Objectives
- Provide a comprehensive overview of the current Israel-Iran conflict status as of June 2025.
- Identify recent major developments, key events, and a timeline of the conflict over the last 6-12 months.
- Pinpoint key geographic locations and affected areas for mapping purposes.
- Compile a list of reliable news sources and APIs for real-time updates.
- Extract key metrics and data points suitable for a dashboard visualization.
- Analyze the regional context and international involvement in the conflict.

## Research Breakdown
- **Current Status Assessment**: Gather up-to-the-minute information on the state of tensions and conflict between Israel and Iran.
- **Recent Developments & Timeline**: Chronicle major incidents, escalations, and political statements from late 2024 to June 2025.
- **Geographic Analysis**: Identify key sites of conflict, military bases, and affected civilian areas.
- **Source Identification**: Find and vet reliable news outlets, APIs, and expert sources for ongoing information.
- **Dashboard Metrics**: Define and collect quantifiable data points relevant to the conflict.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Research the roles of other regional and international actors.

## Key Questions
1. What is the operational status of both Israeli and Iranian military forces?
2. What are the most significant conflict events that have occurred in the past year?
3. Which specific locations in Israel, Iran, and surrounding countries are central to the conflict?
4. What are the most reliable, low-bias sources for news and data on this conflict?
5. What are the key metrics (e.g., number of attacks, casualties, economic impact) that can be tracked on a dashboard?
6. How are countries like the US, Russia, and Saudi Arabia influencing the conflict?

## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources**: I will start by using web searches to find information from reputable news organizations, government websites, and international relations think tanks. I will also search for any available news or data APIs.
- **Search strategies**: I will use a variety of search queries, including "Israel-Iran conflict June 2025," "Israel-Iran timeline 2024-2025," "Middle East conflict analysis," and "news APIs for conflict zones."

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements**: I will use a minimum of 5-7 independent and credible sources for key facts to ensure a balanced and accurate picture.
- **Cross-validation**: I will compare information from Western, Middle Eastern, and other international sources to identify and account for potential biases.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive research file in markdown format (`docs/israel_iran_conflict_report.md`) containing all the research findings.
- A separate file listing reliable news sources and APIs (`docs/israel_iran_conflict_sources.md`).

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus**: Search
- **Justification**: The primary need is to gather a broad range of current information from various sources to build a comprehensive picture of the conflict. Verification will be a key part of the process, but the initial emphasis is on a wide-ranging search.
